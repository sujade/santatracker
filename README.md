<h1><strong>Santa Tracker</strong></h1>

This is a little fun web app that locates where Santa has been throughout his quest to distribute gifts. By hiding fun little messages, the team has tried to create an entertaining and easy-to-use experience and bring people to giggles during the holiday season.

<h1><strong>How It's Made</strong></h1>

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The project was mostly planned around the fact that it should be fun. We came up with a title, an image with a radar screen with Santa faces on. The rest came along together as we decided to make the website more festive with snowfall and some Christmas lights on top. The original generator didn't have a map attached to it and it only gave a countdown, a location, and an activity. After some trial and error, we've decided to implement a map API, Leaflet. It worked well and we've also decided to add a travel log along with a small easter egg under the page, which alerted a random holiday wish when it's clicked. 

<h1><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></h1>

<ul>
<li>Along the way, the team had to learn how to overcome obstacles such as cleaning up the code so that it could be read easier and better. </li>
<li>Our research skills were put to the test since most of the team were still learners and we managed to implement an API that we'd never used before. </li>
<li>Getting enough sleep is crucial. </li>
